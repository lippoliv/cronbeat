# Changes Made

## Fixed Composer Validation

Added the license field to `composer.json`:
- Specified "GPL-3.0-or-later" as the license based on the existing LICENSE file
- Resolved the composer validation error related to missing license information

## Added Testing Infrastructure

1. Created `composer.json` with:
   - PHP 8.4 requirement
   - PHPUnit as a development dependency
   - PSR-4 autoloading for src/Classes/ and tests/ directories

2. Created directory structure:
   - `src/Classes/` for PHP classes
   - `tests/` for unit tests

3. Added a dummy unit test in `tests/DummyTest.php` that:
   - Follows the Given-When-Then pattern as specified in the guidelines
   - Contains two simple test methods that will always pass

4. Set up PHPUnit configuration in `phpunit.xml`:
   - Configured test suite to run all tests in the tests/ directory
   - Set up code coverage for all PHP files in the src/ directory
   - Enabled error reporting

## Added GitHub Workflow

Created a GitHub workflow in `.github/workflows/php-tests.yml` that:
- Runs on any push that touches PHP files, composer.json, composer.lock, phpunit.xml, or the workflow file itself
- Sets up PHP 8.4 with necessary extensions
- Validates composer files
- Installs dependencies
- Runs all PHPUnit tests
- Provides a summary of test results and fails the workflow if any test fails

## How to Run Tests Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run all tests
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run tests with detailed output
vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox
```
