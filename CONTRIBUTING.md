# Contributing to CronBeat

CronBeat is a personal sandbox project to explore and demonstrate what JetBrains Junie can do.

- Feedback is very welcome.
- Code contributions (pull requests) are not expected at this time.

If you have ideas, requests, or find a bug, please open a GitHub Issue. To make your issue as helpful as possible, include:
- What you want to achieve or the problem you are facing
- Expected vs. current behavior
- Clear reproduction steps (for bugs)
- Environment details (PHP version, OS, Docker vs. direct run)
- Any screenshots or logs that help illustrate the issue

If you’re considering a code change anyway, please open an issue first to discuss the approach before investing time. Small documentation fixes are fine to propose via PR.

Thank you for helping improve CronBeat!
